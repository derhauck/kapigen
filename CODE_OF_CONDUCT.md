# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to stay focused on the technical mission and goals of the project. All discussions and feedback should be relevant to the product and its improvement.

## Our Standards

Examples of acceptable behavior:

- Staying on topic and focusing on technical discussions.
- Providing evidence-based arguments.
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback about the product.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Off-topic discussions or comments.
- Non-technical or irrelevant feedback.

## Enforcement

This project will only police off-topic discussions. If a discussion strays from the relevant technical topics, it may be flagged or removed by a moderator.

Repeated violations of this code of conduct may result in a ban. The decision to ban is subjective and will depend on the moderator's discretion at the time of the violation. Bans are final and will not be appealed. If banned, you must create a new account to resume collaboration.

## GitLab's Role

The project is hosted on GitLab, and any actions GitLab takes against users, such as bans, are at their discretion and outside of our control.
